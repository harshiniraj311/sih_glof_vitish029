            <h2>About Glaciers</h2>
            <p>
                Glaciers are massive, slow-moving bodies of ice formed over centuries as snow accumulates and compacts. Found primarily in polar and mountainous regions, they play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate and water systems by storing and releasing freshwater. Due to climate change, glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate, leading to rising sea levels and the formation of glacial lakes. When these lakes overflow, they can cause dangerous floods known as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). These floods pose significant risks to nearby communities, highlighting the urgent need for monitoring and prediction systems to mitigate potential disasters.

            <h2>Our Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Glacier Prediction Project aims to predict potential glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) caused by rapid glacier melting due to climate change. Real-time satellite images of glacial regions are analyzed using machine learning models to detect patterns and predict flood risks. This system provides early warnings to communities living near glaciers, helping mitigate the devastating effects of GLOFs, such as loss of life, property damage, and environmental harm. By integrating real-time data and advanced prediction algorithms, the project enhances disaster preparedness, protects vulnerable populations, and promotes sustainable environmental practices.

            <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
            <p>
                This project is beneficial to society as it focuses on disaster prevention and reducing the risk to communities living near glaciers. Early detection of potential flood risks can save lives, protect property, and prevent environmental damage.
